# Singular.Live Rive Widget  

**Integrating Rive animations into the Singular Live platform for next-gen real-time graphics.**  

This project is an **experimental integration layer** that brings **Rive’s WebGL2-based rendering and ViewModel architecture** into **Singular Live widgets**.  
The goal is to enable seamless use of `.riv` files as live, data-driven overlays directly inside the Singular Live ecosystem — complete with vector feathering, GPU acceleration, and dynamic control via Rive’s ViewModelInstances.


### 🧪 Note  

This project is experimental and rapidly evolving.
