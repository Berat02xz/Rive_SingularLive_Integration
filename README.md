# Singular.Live Rive Widget  

**Integrating Rive animations into the Singular Live platform for next-gen real-time graphics.**  

This project is an **experimental integration layer** that brings **Rive’s WebGL2-based rendering and ViewModel architecture** into **Singular Live widgets**.  
The goal is to enable seamless use of `.riv` files as live, data-driven overlays directly inside the Singular Live ecosystem — complete with vector feathering, GPU acceleration, and dynamic control via Rive’s ViewModelInstances.

## 🧠 Tech Stack  

- **Rive Web Runtime** (WebGL2 + WASM)  
- **Singular Live Widget SDK**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **JSON UI generation system** based on Rive’s ViewModel schema & Singular widget SDK

## 🧱 Roadmap  

- [✅] Parse and visualize Rive ViewModelInstance JSON schema  
- [✅] Auto-generate Singular Live widget UI  
- [✅] Automate `.riv` uploads into Singular projects  
- [ ] Bind all types of Rive data to Singular
- [ ] Exhaustive testing before release

### 🧪 Note  

This project is experimental and rapidly evolving.
